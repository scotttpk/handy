LT155 comprises a range of features such as the hydrostatic [transmission](https://surferhandy.com/husqvarna-lgt2654-transmission-problems/) and a 426CC powerful motor along with other specs that all together aid the tractor in enhancing efficiency and increasing the productivity of all the users.

However, you will often face [John Deere problems](https://surferhandy.com/john-deere-185-hydro-problems/), and how could you not? Any machine assisted with moving parts is bound to have an issue with its operation at one point or another.

We will be dedicating this article to first identifying the causes of the John Deere LT155 problems and then, per those issues proposing measures that you can take to troubleshoot them.

So stick by to learn more about the John Deere LT155 problems!

## [](<>)**Causes & Troubleshooting John Deere LT155 Problems**

Some John Deere LT155 problems that have been reported are going to be discussed in the ***following section.***

![](/uploads/john-deere-lt155-tractor-problems.png)

### [](<>)**Problem: Engine**   

John Deere LT155 has a 15HP Kohler engine. Despite the exceptional qualities that this particular engine model has, it can demonstrate scenarios where the LT155 does not start or restart after use or just simply lapses mid-operation.

Primarily, the reason underlying the resistance from the engine where it does not [start originates](https://surferhandy.com/stihl-ms170-wont-start/) from the [coil for ignition](https://surferhandy.com/stihl-ignition-coil-problems/) that has been installed in the machine.

The ignition coil has gone bad, so it is not delivering a spark and subsequently not powering your LT155 tractor.

However, do not restrict your analysis of the engine not starting to a malfunctioning ignition coil, as there are alternative reasons too.

One alternative reason is that the battery has lost its power and is dead. It is fairly common for the powering battery of your LT155 to stop sourcing the tractor because it has run out of power due to the continuous use of the machine.

Additionally, another reason is the fuel in the tank of the John Deere LT155. When was it last that you refilled the tank? Recall it! Most manufacturers do not advise their users to use the machine if and when the fuel has been left in the [tank](https://surferhandy.com/average-capacity-lawn-mower-gas-tank/) for more than 30 days because there are chances for it to get contaminated.

### [](<>)**Troubleshooting Action**

Now you begin with analyzing the situation where your John Deere LT155’s engine will not start by beginning with the basics. Check for the fuel within the tank. See if the present fuel in the machine is enough to power it.

If you think that the fuel quantity is less, add more. Then start the engine and observe whether the issue of the engine not starting has been troubleshot.

Next up, and if the engine keeps stopping again, you proceed with checking the batteries of the LT155.

If the [battery is dead](https://surferhandy.com/downsides-battery-powered-lawnmowers/), then there is no other way around remedying an engine not starting situation except replacing the old and worn-out batteries with new ones.

Lastly, you are going to be focusing on the ignition coil. Supposedly, the fuel is not problematic, nor are the batteries, then the only problematic component causing you inconvenience is the faulty ignition coil.

Identify the [plug wire](https://surferhandy.com/spark-plug-is-a-bad-lawn-mower/) inside the LT155, check it for current, and remember to notice a spark.

The absence of a spark in the plug wire indicates that the ignition coil has gone bad and that the coil will have to be replaced to get the engine of your tractor up and running.

### [](<>)**Problem: Hydrostatic Transmission**

For your John Deere LT155 to become sluggish is unusual, especially if it stops working in the tracks.

However, if the tractor is running fine when you start it initially but then comes to an immediate halt after operating for a few minutes, this is a cause of concern and must be troubleshot in the first instance.

This issue’s origination can be traced back to the hydrostatic transmission system that it has.

Primary responsibility of the hydrostatic transmission in your LT155 is to successfully and effectively power the wheels through the transmission of power from the engine.

Pressure of liquid in the hydrostatic transmission undertakes the work of regulating and ensuring a smooth rotation of the wheels of your LT155.

Problems with hydrostatic transmission materialize only when there are issues in the oil’s viscosity or cavitation. If the transmission system cannot generate pressure, it will cause the

failure of other related systems, for example, the metal hose or the drive axle. Or if these delicate parts of the hydrostatic transmission are broken, then transmission problems within the system will appear.

The cavitation problem is mainly regarding the oil in the tractor. The level of oil present has been lowered, or the oil has air bubbles in it.

Air pockets form as soon as you shift gears, making the tractor sluggish and challenging to push in fields because there is not enough pressure produced.

### [](<>)**Troubleshooting Action**

Whenever you face such issues, you must immediately fix the hydrostatic transmission system of the LT155.

One way to do this is by purging the system, meaning cleaning the system and removing cavitation by releasing the trapped air bubbles that were hampering the transmission and resulting in your tractor becoming sluggish.

If releasing the air from the system did not improve the hydrostatic transmission operation of your tractor, then you should progress to checking the internal system of the LT155 for damage.

It can be that the driving axle or the metal hose has been broken and demands to be replaced. Sometimes when the metal hose in the tractor breaks down, it results in a leakage where oil leaks and the produced pressure too is not trapped correctly.

An effective troubleshooting action would be to get a new metal hose or fix the cracks and add more oil to the component.

### [](<>)**Problem: Steering**

Imagine driving your John Deere LT155 tractor in one direction, but the machine keeps moving in another.

Is this not taxing for you? This problem comes about in the tractor through the inability of the tractor to steer correctly and accurately.

Steering inability issues include the LT155 not moving to the left, forward, reverse, or suddenly being stuck in a single spot.

Although these inabilities might seem trivial, you should not take them lightly because they risk converting into a situation threatening the user’s safety.

Ground of this issue with the steering is that something within the internal mechanism of the LT155 has gone wrong.

Suppose you have some experience dealing with technical machinery, we advise you to undertake the troubleshooting action yourself—even the slightest negligence.

In contrast, troubleshooting can cause tremendous and costly problems in the LT155.

### [](<>)**Troubleshooting Action**

In the troubleshooting action for the inability of your steering while, we will provide you with certain situations and then look at the given solution according to the situation you have at hand.

When the LT155 is not turning toward the left side of the field despite you making several efforts start by checking for the alignment of the front wheel, whenever the alignment of the front wheel is messed up, you will always have a tough time propelling your tractor toward the left.

So check for the alignment, and then if it has been loosened, tighten the alignment accordingly using a screwdriver.

Another reason why the LT155 is not turning in any direction, nor is it reversing or going forward at your command, then the front axle of the tractor calls for replacement.

Because the front axle has been bent, it is acting as a hindrance in the steering of the tractor.

### [](<>)**Problem: Cutting And Stripping**

What is the purpose of your LT155 if it fails to deliver a smooth cut on your fields? Of the many problems that users have faced with the tractor, one is that LT155 is not [cutting grass](https://surferhandy.com/commercial-mower-for-wet-grass/), and when it does, the machine leaves strips behind it.

Only reason that can be located for this cutting and stripping issue with your John Deere LT155 is because of the blades it has.

When the [blades](https://surferhandy.com/scag-mower-blades/) have gone dull, or they lose their grip, they start acting inefficiently, whereby the grass will not be cut, and strips are left when it is being cut.

### [](<>)**Troubleshooting Action**

Compared to other John Deere LT155 problems, the issue with blades is easier and much more convenient to solve.

All the troubleshooting action requires you to check first whether the blades have lost their sharpness. If the[ blades are sharp](https://surferhandy.com/angle-grinder-for-sharpening-mower-blades/) and still not cutting, leave them as it is, and no replacement must be done.

The second step here will be to observe if the blades are accurately positioned in the LT155.

Often the [blades lose their adjustment](https://surferhandy.com/impact-wrench-for-lawn-mower-blades/) and start moving away from the bolt that fastens and holds them together.

Upon viewing any distance between the bolt and the blades, it is your primary responsibility to fasten them by screwing them together tightly.
