Whether it be the engine not starting or the Husqvarna riding mower headlights not working, all constitute a nuisance.

However, what is the reason for Husqvarna riding mower headlights not working? There can be several reasons why the riding mower headlights stop working, so let’s find out!

## [](<>)**Why Are Husqvarna Riding Mower Headlights Not Working- Causes & Troubleshooting**

It is not uncommon for the Husqvarna riding mower headlights not working, which happens for many users.

In fact, the headlights issue is one of the most common problems customers report facing with their riding lawnmowers, so rest assured, you are not the only victim.

One thing that you must keep in mind at all times is that there is not an identified single reason for your Husqvarna riding mower headlights not working.

Multiple reasons can be the originating source for headlights stopping to work. Therefore, we will be stating more than a single cause, which could be why Husqvarna riding mower headlights are not working.

### [](<>)**Problem: Stator Has Been Damaged.**

The damage to the stator is not linked to the span you have been utilizing your Husqvarna riding mower for.

Stator is independent of all the other components of the [mower](https://surferhandy.com/lawn-mower-for-elderly/). Even when the mower may be in a perfectly healthy condition or recently purchased, the stator can easily get damaged.

A significant responsibility of the stator of your Husqvarna riding mower is to generate electricity to power the machine’s headlights.

Located under the [flywheel](https://surferhandy.com/pull-cord-not-engage-flywheel/), the stator of the mower is a primary source for the headlights to work.

Even when the [ignition switch](https://surferhandy.com/stihl-ignition-coil-problems/) of the Husqvarna riding mower is working appropriately, if the stator has been damaged, Husqvarna riding lawnmower headlights will not work.

#### [](<>)**Troubleshoot**

Out of the many components that, when going damaged or flawed, have no other way of being fixed other than replacement, the stator of your husqvarna riding mower is one of them.

Once the stator has been damaged, there is no other way to restore its functioning apart from opting for the option of replacement.

To get the headlights of your Husqvarna riding mower working again, you must replace or get the stator replaced.

While you are at it, purchase a stator compatible with the Husqvarna model of your riding mower. Make sure all the specs match, or take the damaged stator to the retailer and ask the shopkeeper for a similar one!

### [](<>)**Problem: Disassembled Plug**

Have you ever had an experience with your Husqvarna riding mower whereby upon starting the machine, the engine is roaring ideally, the bulbs have not worn out, but the headlights still won’t light up?

Even when you check the fuse, it is in good condition, and all the connecting wire seems to be working fine. Then what is it that is causing Husqvarna riding mower headlights not working?

The answer to your concern is that the plug near or around your riding mower’s hood has been disassembled.

This plug-in for the riding mower is not only required to aid combustion but also works toward ensuring that the headlights keep working.

#### [](<>)**Troubleshoot**

In the situation where the plug inside the Husqvarna riding mower has been disassembled, you got to assemble it, and for this, you will need a set of pliers, the needle-nose ones.

A prerequisite to the assembly is first locating the plug in the machine precisely. Look near the hood of the machine, precisely on the left side hinge of the mower, and you will notice two wires showing out.

Out of the two emerging wires, one will be a white wire and the other a black wire. Use your pliers to twist the wires.

The black wire will have to be twisted around and gently in a clockwise direction, whereas the white one will have to be twisted counterclockwise.

With twisting of these wires, the connection previously providing power to the headlights to keep them lit will be reinstated as it has now been tightened and put back into the right place.

However, even after tightening the wires and [starting the mower](https://surferhandy.com/honda-gcv160-not-starting/), if you notice that the Husqvarna riding mower headlights are not working, we say you replace the plug once and for all.

### [](<>)**Problem: Corroded Switch**

Switch inside the Husqvarna riding mower is the primary source of ensuring that an adequate amount of electricity reaches the headlights.

However, this switch can be prone to corroding if you have not used the [riding mower](https://surferhandy.com/riding-mower-noise-blades-engaged/) for a long time, causing it to malfunction.

This means that if the switch has gone bad, no source will transmit power to the headlights, causing the Husqvarna riding mower headlights not to work.

#### [](<>)**Troubleshoot**

The only method to troubleshoot a corroded switch in the [lawnmower](https://surferhandy.com/push-mower-for-lawn-care-business/) is to replace it.

Although the replacement task is a bit technical, you can easily undertake the procedure with some patience and a few necessary tools.

Patience is demanded when looking for the switches because, for different models, the switches are placed in different locations; however, you must start by looking at the most common one.

Typically such switches are placed near the headlamps, so look closely here. After determining the location, remove the worn-out switches and place the new ones.

### [](<>)**Problem: Wiring Is Burned**

Another reason why Husqvarna riding mower headlights are not working is that one of the wires or many of them supplying power to the headlights has been burned.

By burned, we mean to imply here that due to being exposed to constant wear and tear and to heat, the wires have cracked or broken, hence unable to deliver their function.

When the wiring is burned, your Husqvarna riding mower’s headlights will not work in such situations.

Two basic wires transmit power to the headlights directly sourcing it from the battery, and if either has been worn out, the transmission will be disrupted.

#### [](<>)**Troubleshoot**

Upon suspicion of headlights not working or dimming, eventually, after you start your Husqvarna riding mower, you must instantly check the wires.

Closely inspect the wires to identify any signs of burnout or damage.

Upon encountering any damage, immediately replace the wires that can be easily purchased and are readily available at all local hardware stores.

Finding the correct wires for your riding mower will not be a task.

## [](<>)**Conclusion**

Now that you know all the reasons for Husqvarna riding mower headlights not working, we hope you can quickly troubleshoot the problem.
