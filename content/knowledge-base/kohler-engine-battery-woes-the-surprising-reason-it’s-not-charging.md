faqs:
  - question: "**How often can I face the issue of the Kohler engine not charging
      the battery?**"
    answer: There is no frequency rate related to how often you can face the issue
      of the Kohler engine not charging the battery.
  - question: "**What if you cannot clean the corrosion on the terminals?**"
    answer: In this situation, find alternatives. Maybe consider purchasing new
      terminals because corroded ones will lapse in their function later, if not
      sooner, lapse in their function.
  - question: "**Are fuses for the Kohler engine readily available?**"
    answer: Yes, they are easily available.

With the lapsing time, the previously infamous Kohler engines have now gained significant popularity amongst users.

They are now being installed as the primary power source in many machines.

> Whether your machine has been manufactured to source a small-scale domestic purpose or a large-scale and professional task does not matter.

With a vast and diversified range, the Kohler engine powers all the machines.

There is no doubting the delivered potential of the Kohler engine; however, sometimes, users who utilize machines with a Kohler engine complain that their Kohler engine does not charge the battery. ***Why is this happening so?***

Let’s look deeper into these problems and discover why the Kohler engine is not charging the battery.

So if you are a Kohler engine machine owner, this article is important!

## [](<>)**Why Is My Kohler Engine Not Charging Battery?**

As much as having issues with the Kohler engine not charging battery may seem complicated and technical, they are not and, in fact, can be fixed quite easily.

![](/uploads/kohler-enine-battery-1-.png)

But first, you must know the originating cause for why the Kohler engine is not charging the battery, and there can be multiple reasons for this case.

### [](<>)**Battery Connection and Terminal Failure**

We all know that there are two particular terminals on any power source on which you put the wires responsible for transmitting the charges to the required area.

These two terminals are negative and positive terminals that ensure a connection from your Kohler engine to the battery.

The color red typically indicates positive compared to the negative side, usually black.

Although transmitting both charges is crucial for your Kohler engine to charge the battery, the negative charge is more important as it tends to be the grounding electrode.

Supposedly, suppose the labels have been crossed where the cable you should plug into the positive terminal has been connected to the negative terminal or vice versa. In that case, there will be a disruption in the charge’s [transmission](https://surferhandy.com/husqvarna-lgt2654-transmission-problems/).

Even though the terminals are doing their job of producing the charge, since the cables have been crossed, they are not delivering this charge adequately from the Kohler engine to the battery.

They are resulting in the Kohler engine not charging the battery.

Another reason that can result in the engine’s failure to charge the battery is that the terminals have corroded.

These terminals are made out of metal. Therefore, their corrosion is a process that is bound to occur either sooner or later and subsequently interferes with the delivery of voltage to the battery.

### [](<>)**Checking Fuel System**

What happens to the engine when there is insufficient fuel in the [fuel tank](https://surferhandy.com/stihl-fuel-tank-vent-problems/)? The simple and intuitive answer to this is that the engine does not start, or it somehow starts, only to lapse immediately mid-operation.

[Fuel](https://surferhandy.com/stihl-motomix-vs-trufuel/) is not only necessary to start the engine but it s also to ensure that the engine-related functions, such as powering other components of the machine, are sustained.

Through this claim, we mean to imply that if the fuel tank is deprived of an adequate amount of fuel, then the issue of the Kohler engine not charging the battery will arise.

Either the fuel tank is empty, or the fuel has gone bad, alongside another possibility of the delivering fuel lines being worn out.

If disrupted, anything related to fuel or its transmission can result in the Kohler engine not charging the battery. 

### [](<>)**Inspecting Fuses**

To prevent the engine from wearing out because of overheating or exposure to continuous use.

These fuses guarantee to safeguard the electrical components in the Kohler engine, for example, the brake and the engine itself, from going defective.

Just like your ordinary engines, the Kohler engine too is equipped with fuses, and rest assured, the fuses are present there for all the good reasons and to prolong the life of the engine.

Within the Kohler engine, fuses restrict the voltage flow and protect other engine components in case the engine gets overheated or overloaded.

However, in often instances where the fuses make an explosion which occurs mostly because of an overcurrent, the fuse blows out and fails to restrict voltage.

When this happens, no electricity will get through the battery as the condition of the ordinary rectifier, and the optional fuse is not met.

Thus, leading to the issue of the Kohler engine not charging the battery.

### [](<>)**Inoperative charger**

All along in this section, we have been considering quite some technical possibilities for why the Kohler engine is not charging batt.

This often happens in real life, too, that we proceed to examine the unidentified difficulties while ignoring the ones that might just lie in the invisible present.

All that being said, the question to explore is, have you considered the possibility that the charger you are using to charge the battery from your Kohler engine might be the reason for the Kohler engine not charging the battery instead of all the other explanations that we have provided?

![](/uploads/battery-charger.png)

Well, to be very plausible, an inoperative charger is the first thing you should check for as soon as you encounter Kohler engine not charging battery, and to fix that, just purchase a new charger!

## [](<>)**Solutions**

### [](<>)**Fixing Terminal Failure**

In this part, we will suggest two solutions to the battery connection problem and terminal failure. First, check if the wires are connected to the accurate terminals.

As we stated earlier, if there is a mismatch in the connection of wires with the terminals, the charge will not be delivered.

So examine the terminals and the wires to see whether this problem is not occurring. If not, counter the corroding of your terminals, which is also a very straightforward method.

All this method demands is a sharp and blunt wire brush and baking soda to deeply cleanse the terminals and their adjacent cable connectors and connectors.

Once you are done cleaning, you will notice that the terminals appear shinier and less rusty, indicating that you have successfully countered the corroding terminals, at least to some extent.

### [](<>)**Troubleshooting Fuel Problems**

The fuel problem is rapid to troubleshoot. There are only specific measures that have to be undertaken which will, within no time, prevent the problem of the Kohler engine not charging the battery.

One [troubleshooting](https://surferhandy.com/troubleshooting-craftsman-25cc-weedwacker/) option is to check the fuel tank and see if the liquid is adequate- is there enough fuel in the tank to combust the engine? Also, is the present fuel contaminated?

Fuel contamination will occur when the fuel in the tank has been left in the machine for at least 30 days or more.

If that’s the scenario, immediately drain the liquid, and refill the tank with new fuel. Progressing to another troubleshooting for the fuel problem is to evaluate the fuel tank’s condition.

See if there are any contaminants or dirt buildups within the tank or the fuel filter, which is primarily responsible for filtering the fuel.

If, for any reason, the lines have cracked or worn out, the fuel tank is clean, the fuel is uncontaminated, and the fuel is adequate, the fuel will not be delivered to the engine, resulting in the Kohler engine not charging the battery.

### [](<>)**Replacing The Fuses**

There is no way to fix worn-out fuses other than replacing them.

Therefore, purchase the most appropriate fuses for your Kohler engine from a trusted online website or your local hardware store and replace the old ones to prevent the Kohler engine from charging the battery.

For the replacement procedure, utilize the fuse pliers provided within the fuse box, which assist you in inserting or removing the fuses and can be a valuable tool while replacing the old ones.

## [](<>)**Conclusion**

Now that you know what is causing your Kohler engine not charging battery, troubleshooting these issues should not be arduous!
