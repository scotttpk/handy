faqs:
  - question: "**Should I replace or clean the clogged parts of my Tecumseh
      snowblower?**"
    answer: It depends. If you think the clogging is severe and you cannot get rid
      of it, then replacing the clogged component in your snowblower is the
      preferred option.
  - question: "**Is checking for a spark in a spark plug safe, or will I be
      electrocuted?**"
    answer: Checking for a spark in a spark plug using a spark plug tester is safe
      and will not result in electrocution. Even if you use an ordinary tester,
      you still will not be electrocuted because the spark is not so robust.

Supposedly, if you reside in an area where winters remain for a massive part of the year, you cannot do without a snowblower.

The snowblower is essential for you to survive such harsh conditions where removing snow out of the way is a task that you cannot undertake manually.

Thankfully, and to your fortune, Tecumseh has manufactured a snowblower just per your needs, ensuring that you never have to clear the snow off your path again manually.

However, this can only be avoided when the Tecumseh snowblower keeps delivering its function efficiently, if and in the case where the operation is disrupted, you are back to clearing the snow manually.

The only situation where the snowblower fails in its purpose is when the Tecumseh snowblower engine surging. Don’t fret. We have causes and solutions for the surging engine of your Tecumseh snowblower.

## [](<>)**Causes for Tecumseh Snowblower Engine Surging**

Now, a surging engine within any machine, whether it be your [snowblower](https://surferhandy.com/simplicity-vs-toro-snowblower/) or your [lawnmower](https://surferhandy.com/mower-for-20-acres/), is always an accurate indication of a combustion problem.

When such a problem arises, they only result in the operation being problematic regarding a primary concern with the engine functioning.

### [](<>)**Carburetor Is Clogged**

Often, your Tecumseh Snowblower engine surges because something in the carburetor has gone wrong.

What is that “something” in the carburetor? But first, you must know that the [carburetor](https://surferhandy.com/fuel-leaking-carburetor-intake-weed-eater/) of your snowblower engine holds the fundamental responsibility of facilitating internal combustion, whereby it mixes the [air and fuel](https://surferhandy.com/401-vs-501/).

When the Tecumseh snowblower engine surges, your first guess should be a problematic carburetor.

The engine’s Carburetor might have been clogged, which is likely to happen when the snowblower user leaves the fuel in the engine to remain for a long time.

For example, it is summer now, and you no longer need the snowblower, so you store the machine away with fuel.

But upon retrieval and use, you encounter that the engine is surging- this is happening because of clogging in the carburetor through the build-up of the constituents in the fuel.

Some fuel constituents evaporated over time and left behind a sticky thicker substance.

When you restarted the Tecumseh snowblower, this substance immediately clogged the carburetor, causing your engine to surge.

### [](<>)**Fuel Cap Contaminated**

We have repeatedly heard about the fuel getting contaminated within the [fuel tank](https://surferhandy.com/stihl-fuel-tank-vent-problems/) if left unused for 30 days or more.

But fuel cap contamination is a comparatively newer idea and happens within your Tecumseh snowblower resulting in the engine surging.

As the fuel consumption by your snowblower is continuous, considering that the machine is being used consistently, then the level of present fuel is bound to lower, later if not sooner.

To make up for all the fuel consumed, there is a tiny vent in the fuel tank that allows the air to enter the tank and compensate for the low fuel levels.

When the fuel cap vent gets clogged for dirt or any other reason, the air will be blocked and will not be entering the tank anymore, creating a “**vapor**” or “**vacuum**” lock.

This phenomenon significantly impacts the occurring combustion in the engine since we know that air is required for combustion.

In the case where the fuel is low, and the air is absent only when a predicated consequence happens with your Tecumseh snowblower engine, and that is- surging.

### [](<>)**Damaged Spark Plug**

Spark plug is another essential component required for combustion to occur in an engine. The component ensures that electricity sparks successfully [ignite the engine](https://surferhandy.com/stihl-ignition-coil-problems/) to have it combust right in time when needed.

However, when the spark plug is damaged, which is likely due to continuous use of the Tecumseh snowblower without any breaks in between, the plug will wear out.

Wearing out will only aid some combustion of the fuel in the engine, which means that now the engine will be problematic and surge recurrently.

## [](<>)**Solutions for Engine Surging**

### [](<>)**Cleaning Clogged Carburetor**

Tackling the issue of a clogged carburetor in Tecumseh snowblower is easy in the sense that just by profoundly cleansing the component, you can get rid of the sticky substance that has now invaded the space within the carburetor and is causing the engine to surge.

Start by taking the carburetor out of your snowblower. Once the carburetor is detached from within the machine, deeply cleanse the component where no dirt builds up.

For that sake, any sticky material deposited via the fuel stays on the carburetor.

You can cleanse the carburetor using an effective cleansing spray or liquid, which will ensure that without causing any hassle to you or demanding any efforts by your side- it rids off the build-up in part.

Once cleaned, attach the carburetor to your Tecumseh snowblower again and start the machine. Observe whether the engine is still surging or not. To get a better and more specific idea of the machine.

If no improvement is seen in the engine’s operation and it is still surging, then to fix the combustion issue and restore proper combustion, you must replace the carburetor with a new kit.

### [](<>)**Fixing Fuel Cap**

To fix the fuel cap, you can undertake two measures. One is to unclog the fuel cap to clean it so densely that no dirt or filth is left in it; the second is to save yourself the time and effort of struggling with cleansing and instead opt for replacement.

However, to proceed with cleansing the fuel cap to fix the surging issue in your Tecumseh snowblower, first, it is crucial to determine whether the fuel vent is clogged.

You can have your answer by loosening the cap slightly and then igniting the engine.

After starting the engine, if you notice that the engine keeps running, the answer to your query is that the issue is, in fact, within the fuel cap and has been clogged.

What happens with the loosening of the fuel cap is that it allows the air to enter the snowblower, so now the engine runs and does not surge.

### [](<>)**Replace Worn Out Spark Plug**

Although you might suspect the spark plug is worn out, resulting in the Tecumseh Snowblower engine surging without enough confidence, you must not proceed.

Therefore, you must determine and can conveniently access whether the [spark plug](https://surferhandy.com/champion-spark-plug-stihl-chainsaw/) is the issue by checking it for a spark using a tester.

If you witness a strong immediate spark within the terminal while the engine cranks, the need for replacement is eliminated; however, if you witness otherwise- no spark- then replace the spark plug instantly.
