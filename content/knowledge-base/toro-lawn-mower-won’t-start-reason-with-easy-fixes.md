## **Why is my Toro Lawn Mower not Starting? Reasons With What To Do!**

If your toro lawn mower isn’t starting, we got you **11 problems with troubleshooting** and fixing methods to make the lawn mower back to work, but who is the culprit? Check out!

### **Check Out The Fuel Gas**

* Low gas
* Bad gas
* Wrong gas

First, you need to check whether there is enough gas in your Toro gas tank, whether the [gas is fresh or not](https://surferhandy.com/old-gas-cause-mower-not-start/), or whether you are using the correct gas type. All these reasons might be related to the gas that won’t get that tomorrow not to start.

#### **Low fuel gas**

Most of the time, users get so frustrated that they don’t check the significant issues or forget to check that there isn’t any fuel left in the [tank](https://surferhandy.com/stihl-fuel-tank-vent-problems/).

![](/uploads/old-fuel.png)

So, whenever your [toro lawn mower](https://surferhandy.com/toro-zero-turn-lawnmower-runs-shutsoff/) isn’t starting, check the fuel tank, and if there isn’t any oil, add some; that would be the significant fix to opt for. Try using regular unleaded gasoline.

#### **Aged fuel**

Another issue with gas fuel might be that you last changed the gas a long time ago. What if your [mower](https://surferhandy.com/commercial-mower-for-wet-grass/) was stored for months and years, and you are now starting it up for your work without any fuel check and change?

In that case, the older gasoline might be causing a problem like clogging or preventing the engine from adequately using the fuel.

It is because, after 30 days, gas becomes aged and starts to break down this breakdown makes the oil fuel terrible, which isn’t suitable for your [lawn mower](https://surferhandy.com/lawn-mower-for-elderly/), or ethanol absorbs moisture-forming clogging material.

So, check whether the fuel has aged when you use the equipment. If aged, try having a fresh oil to make it start quickly.

Before adding fresh fuel, try to drain the old fuel, flush it, clean it, and stabilize it, then go with fresh fuel.

#### **Wrong fuel**

What if the mower has fuel but still needs to start? There might be issues with the wrong fuel. The Toro, except for regular gasoline, contains an octane rating of 87 and 10% ethanol. The lower the ethanol, the better the fuel gas because ethanol absorbs moisture.

For your lawn mower, any other fuel might cause issues and damage the engine leading to no start.

Therefore, purchase unleaded gasoline with Octane Level 87 and less ethanol % to ensure suitable gas for your mover.

### **Check out the spark plug and compression parts.**

For your lawn mower to start actively, you require a quality spark plug with correct and timely firing.

If your are [spark plug](https://surferhandy.com/spark-plug-is-a-bad-lawn-mower/) is deposited with oil buildup or Carbon, then there are chances that your toro lawnmower won’t start because of failed spark plug firing; another reason might be wrongly kept if your spark plug isn’t well, then there chances that it does not good connection leading to failing startup.

In addition to the spark plug, you may also have issues with the head gasket walls, Piston rings, and valves that aren’t creating adequate compression for your toro lawn mower in an easy startup.

The fuel gas spark plugs and compression all three play a significant role in the start of your equipment, and if any problem exists, then you won’t be able to start your engine, so how do you troubleshoot it? Let’s check out the test!

#### **Gas Shot Test**

To check the fueling, compression, and Spark plug faults in your toro lawn mower, perform the gas shot test; it requires clean gasoline and your toro lawn mower to initiate the test.

The test involves adding fresh oil directly to the corporator so far that the user needs to remove the air filter with its cover.

Once removed, keep the nuts aside. Add a new 87 Octane standard gasoline cap in the mower carburetor. Make the gas reach the carburetor. Now it’s time to make a startup.

* If the [mower starts](https://surferhandy.com/honda-gcv160-not-starting/) or attempts, then there is an issue with the fuel. Because the engine has started means, the pistons and spark plug are working.
* If the engine isn’t starting, meaning spark plug issues. It might have gone wrong.

#### **Fix**

If the spark plug is gone, inspect it, clean the deposits, and replace it if it is still not working or seems terrible. Ensure correct gapping.

### **Check Out Gas Cap**

Now that you have checked the fueling, but still your Toro engine isn’t starting, then another issue would be you haven’t checked the Toro gas cap because sometimes with if it is clogged, then the air isn’t allowed in the gas tank which leads to a vacuum buildup allow your toro lawnmower to use the gas and able to run restriction cause of vacuum is because of the clock Safety purpose you need to.

![](/uploads/cap.png)

#### **Test**

How to know if the air going is blocked, the engine won’t start, but when you remove the cap and start the engine, it would automatically startup; if this is the case, your fuel-air vent is the issue, so fix it accordingly.

#### **Fix**

Check out the vent; it’s the small opening in the gas cap. Clean it if gone bad or replace it to let the engine use the fuel to make the lawn mower able to start and run efficiently.

### **Check Out the Fuel Pump**

Another Case where your toro lawn mower won’t start is the fuel pump has gone wrong, or you cannot pump the fuel out of the pump. In that case, if there seems to be any fault, the mower won’t start.

![](/uploads/fuel-pump.png)

#### **Test**

To check the issue, you need to use the shut-off valve to check whether the fuel is pumping out or not; as the fuel is pumping out, then the fuel form is good; if not, then there is an issue with the fuel pump.

The fuel sitting on the pump causes degradation of the fuel pump parts like its plastic components or sensitive components that won’t cause the mower to start leading to the stoppage.

#### **Fix**

If you find the fuel pump faulty, you must replace it, purchase a new one, and let the equipment start quickly.

### **Check Out Air Filter**

Most outdoor equipment requires air to operate efficiently because while working, the more engine generates heat, the air causes the engine to cool down and work better blocked. The air won’t be system causing heating.

The overheating may degrade many engine parts leading to Indian stoppage and overall immobility of the mover. Hence, you must troubleshoot the issue if you find the air filter plugged into your toro lawn mower.

![](/uploads/air-filter.png)

#### **Fix**

Check the air filter; you must clean or replace it if it is plugged in. For a paper air filter, clean it by removing the dirt buildup.

If having foam filters, then those filters require a fix to replace them. After doing the fix, start the mower; if running, you get the fix; if not, there might be other issues.

### **Check Out the Fuel Filter**

Still, needs to be fixed? Try checking the fuel filter if you find Dort and grime plugging the filter; that might be the case for your toro lawn mower not to start.

Because of clogging and plugging, the fuel won’t be supplied to the engine leading to no startup.

![](/uploads/fuel-filter.png)

#### **Fix**

If the fuel filter is clogged, try replacing the one.

### **Check Out Fuel Line**

Sometimes instead of the fuel filter, the [fuel line pump](https://surferhandy.com/primer-bulb-fuel-line-routing/) is clogged, and it’s because the particulates can pass the filter, but because of some reason, they form clogging material in the fuel line. In that case, the fuel is again not supplied to the engine, and no equipment startup is seen.

To troubleshoot the issue and find that the fuel lines have clogged, all you need is to remove the housing and place it in a bowl or container.

With the help of a shut-off wall and clamps, ensure the fuel flow is flowing freely. If there isn’t any issue with the fuel line, fuel will come out in the container. But if the fuel isn’t flowing freely, a clog requires removal.

#### **Fix**

Now that you have found an issue with the fuel line, you need to remove the clogging in the line but how? Securely remove the fuel line and use a spray carb cleaner with compressed air to remove the particulates.

If your line is free from clogging material, the engine starts if the fuel line is unable to get clean, then you need to replace it with a new one, and again it would make the engine back to work. 

### **Check Out Carburetor**

Have you checked out your carburetor before Consulting a professional for your lawn mower to not start? If not, then you must check out because it’s the place where the air and fuel mixture regulates because of that combustion occurs.

But what if your carburetor must be serviced or cleaned over months and years? It simply leads to dirt, build up, or has been blocked.

In both cases, there won’t be any combustion or energy generation and no startup of your toro lawn mower.

#### **Fix**

It would help if you first inspected the carburetor for dirt buildup to fix the issue. If it exists, clean it without damaging the parts, or if the carburetor has gone bad or has a damaged part, you need to replace it. Remember, for cleaning, use carb cleaner to eliminate dirt build.

### **Check Out Recoil**

Having a toro push remover and facing no startup might cause lousy recoil. Its startup is based on the recoiling containing pulley, springs, and clips for toro push Mowers.

If any of these parts gets broke down or failed to operate, the required recoil isn’t initiated, and no startup of the mover is seen. To inspect the issue, open the recoiling part, and check for the broken parts to fix.

#### **Fix**

If you find any broken parts, the pulley is gone bad, or the spring is missing or broken, you need to replace it with new parts to return the system to work. Replace them and start the mower. Hopefully, it will start!

### **Check Out Starter**

Whether having an [ignition](https://surferhandy.com/stihl-ignition-coil-problems/) switch for starting or a starter solenoid, in both cases, any system issue causes the lawn mower not to start.

For the ignition switch, if gone bad won’t let your Toro start easily. Take a multimeter and go for testing the ignition coil or switch. If you find it faulty, you must replace it to restore the engine.

If your toro lawn mower uses a starter solenoid and causes Hum or click sound when starting, there is an issue with the solenoid.

What if you see smoke or the melting of wires in your mower? It may be because of a bad solenoid, so if such occurs directly, replace the solenoid starter to prevent further damage and let the engine start easily.

But how to Make it? Add 03 spoons of baking soda in 02 cups of water and mix. Now with the help of a Brush, clean the terminals gently to remove the corrosion. Once done start, the engine starts, then good!

If not, check out the loose cables. Check the battery to see if there are no loose cables and still not starting.

If the battery isn’t showing 12.7 volts on your multimeter, then there is an issue with the battery that either charges the battery or it’s low. But what if it is full but still not starting the engine? A simple fix is to replace it.
