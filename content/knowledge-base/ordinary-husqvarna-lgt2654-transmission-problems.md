There is no doubt in the statement that out of all the models manufactured by [Husqvarna](https://surferhandy.com/chainsaw/husqvarna/), one of their outstanding models stands to be the LGT2654.

Only with [three blades installed](https://surferhandy.com/impact-wrench-for-lawn-mower-blades/) in the riding lawnmower, the machine outdoes other mower’s when it comes to efficiency.

Users have been fans of this product ever since it was released and have repeatedly reviewed the product to be value for money and a machine fit for [mowing grass](https://surferhandy.com/blades-for-exmark-lazer-z60/) on large and small-scale fields.

However, where there have been good reviews about the Husqvarna LGT2654, some customers have also reported a few issues arising, whose origin can be all linked back to a- transmission problem.

We will be devoting this article to evaluating the causes of Husqvarna LGT2654 transmission problems and proposing quick troubleshoots.

***So stick by!***

## [](<>)**Typical Causes for Husqvarna LGT2654 Transmission Problems**

A transmission is the sole reason and the core cause for any machine to operate optimally. This is because transmission ensures that power generated from the engine successfully reaches all the machine parts that must be sourced.

Similar is the case with Husqvarna LGT2654, whose effective and exceptional transmission has always made sure for the user to face no inconvenience.

Still, when the transmission is disrupted, you will likely face Husqvarna LGT2654 transmission problems.

In this section, we will be taking a more comprehensive look at all those issues that can materialize when there is an issue with the transmission of your [lawnmower](https://surferhandy.com/commercial-mower-for-wet-grass/).

### [](<>)**Decreased Oil Levels**

Reiterating a key takeaway: transmission is essential for your LGT2654 to run. Without the engine receiving significant power, it will not start, and all your tasks will remain unattended.

One reason you might be facing the speed of your Husqvarna tractor constantly decreasing is that the oil levels in the machine are low.

![](/uploads/lgt5654-husqvarna-oil-level.png)

Although the engine demands fuel for your lawnmower to run, it will fail to perform its function if there is insufficient lubrication of the engine’s parts.

The only case of insufficient engine lubrication is when the oil levels in the Husqvarna lawnmower are low.

With a shallow level of oil in the machine, the engine at no cost will be lubricated, which means that the engine will not start and, even when it does, will lapse mid-operation due to overheating.

Overheating, too, is a common cause of low levels of oil lubricating the engine because now since the parts of the engine are not lubricated due to friction, they are generating more heat than what is being released into the atmosphere.

### [](<>)**Leakage Of Oil,**

A prerequisite to avoiding any problem regarding transmission in your Husqvarna LGT2654 is always to ensure that there is no problem with the quality of the oil or its quantity and there are no loopholes within the transmission lines of the oil.

In any of the cases stated above, such as when the oil leaks through the pipes responsible for delivering oil to other parts of LGT2654, a transmission problem will likely emerge whereby the [lawnmower](https://surferhandy.com/too-much-oil-to-gasoline-for-lawnmowers/) will be functioning at an average.

![](/uploads/oil-leakage.png)

This happens because a [leakage in oil](https://surferhandy.com/toro-snowblower-leaking-gas/) delivery substantially decreases the amount of produced internal pressure causing difficulties in shifting gears.

One way of conveniently identifying that the oil is leaking within some internal component of your tractor is to observe whether the shifting of gears is eventually becoming challenging.

Supposedly, shifting gears is now becoming a task. In the following section, you must refer to our second quick troubleshooting option (fixing the leaking oil transmission).

### **Oil’s Viscosity,**

The sort of oil you are pouring into your Husqvarna LGT2654 is a crucial determinant and can be another cause for you facing transmission problems in your [riding lawnmower](https://surferhandy.com/riding-mower-noise-blades-engaged/).

Oil’s viscosity indicates the convenience of pouring oil and how it will function in your machine at any given temperature.

Oils with lower viscosity can be poured easily when temperatures are low compared to oil with higher viscosity.

If you are working under low temperatures, you should always consult the manual guide to double-check the sort of oil that your LGT2654 demands, but most likely, it will also advise you to add thin oil to reduce the generated friction.

Now that you know the external temperatures impact the viscosity of the oil in your Husqvarna tractor, you must always choose the oil that guarantees to work appropriately, given your surroundings.

### [](<>)**Cavitation**

A problem that frequently arises and results in *Husqvarna LGT2654 transmission problems* is the issue of cavitation. Supposedly, air from the atmosphere finds its way into your [riding lawnmower’s](https://surferhandy.com/hours-should-riding-mower-last/) internal transmission system.

Then it will disrupt the entire system, causing bubbles in the oil transmission lines, slowing transmission.

![](/uploads/husqvarna-5654lgt.png)

The above-described situation is known as Cavitation. Even though no direct cause has been identified for cavitation in your Husqvarna lawnmower, rest assured the phenomenon occurs often.

Cavitation leads to the pump not generating the needed pressure in the oil, further failing in transmission. Also, if the air bubbles invade any of the oil delivery lines, that can slow down the functioning of the Husqvarna LGT2654.

One way to identify the cavitation issue in your lawnmower is to watch for the following:

* Has the noise produced by your riding lawnmower increased?
* Are there any unexpected and unprecedented vibrations in the mower?
* Are the seals leaking or failing to perform the function?
* Is LGT2654 becoming challenging to drive?

If you can identify one or more of the symptoms, then without any more speculation, you can conclude that the transmission problem arises from oil cavitation.

## [](<>)**Quick Troubleshoot For LGT2654 Transmission Problems**

### [](<>)**Keep The Oil Levels Maintained**

Running your LGT2654 on low oil levels is never an ideal option. Let us convince you why. The sole reason for this recommendation is that massive damage can be done to your [engine](https://surferhandy.com/small-engine-tachometer/), ceasing it from delivering any function and costing you hefty amounts on the repair.

![](/uploads/oil-level-maintain.png)

When there is a minimum level of oil, then no or some, which is inadequate, lubrication of the engine occurs while it keeps running like ordinary.

The scenario is that the engine keeps running continuously. Since the oil is not adequately lubricating the component, the engine gets bound to be worn out quite sooner than expected.

### [](<>)**Fixing Leaking Oil Transmission**

Now, there is no straightforward method to fix leaking oil in your LGT2654 tractor. This is because numerous transmission lines are installed in the mower delivering oil to various parts of the machine.

Experiencing challenging shifting in gears does not necessarily indicate that the particular line transmitting oil to the gears has been broken or cracked.

At first, and to avoid jumping to a conclusion, you will have to start by looking for the problematic oil transmission delivery pipe.

![](/uploads/oil-leak.png)

Take a closer look at all the transmission of oil lines in your Husqvarna lawnmower one by one and with patience, and examine every line for cracks.

Also, while you are at it, sometimes the cracks may not be prominently visible, so see if, by the condition, you can conclude that a particular delivery pipe has been worn out.

If it has, then this line could be a reason for oil leakage.

When you have succeeded in identifying the transmission line causing the oil to leak in its delivery, either replace that pipe or try fixing it.

### [](<>)**Solving The Issue of Cavitation**

The easiest way to eliminate cavitation in Husqvarna LGT2654, causing a transmission problem, is to increase the oil level in the machine.

Because oil bubbles are formed within the liquid, you can eliminate them by adding more of the [oil mixture](https://surferhandy.com/401-vs-501/) into the tank.

This is one way, though no guarantee adding more oil can eradicate the air bubbles invading the oil in your riding lawnmower. Regardless, it always remains an option.

Another way to troubleshoot cavitation is using a suction pump to pop any free-floating air bubbles in the oil. However, this is a rather technical troubleshooting that you might not be able to perform independently.

Therefore, it is best to consult experts in the field to help you solve the issue of cavitation.
