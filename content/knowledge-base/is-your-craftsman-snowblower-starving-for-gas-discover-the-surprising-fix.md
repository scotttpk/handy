faqs:
  - question: "**If the coil of the snowblower is broken, will the engine start?**"
    answer: No, the snowblower to start requires that the coil is not broken. If the
      coil is broken, replace it instantly to restore the normal functioning of
      the machine.
  - question: "**Oil is low in the snowblower, but the gas is full, and the engine
      is not starting. Why?**"
    answer: A low level of oils is not lubricating the engine, and despite the full
      gas tank, the snowblower is not starting.
  - question: "**No cracks on delivery lines, but is the snowblower not getting gas?**"
    answer: In this situation, see whether the delivery lines have been clogged due
      to a build-up.

Any related problem to the fuel in your [Craftsman](https://surferhandy.com/troubleshooting-craftsman-25cc-weedwacker/) snowblower, whether it be related to the fuel not being available in an adequate amount or the fuel going bad, will automatically result in issues with starting the engine materializing.

One primary and recurrent issue you will face with your engine is the inability to get your snowblower up and running.

Trust us when we tell you that facing engine problems is only inconvenient. You will constantly be stuck worrying about trying new methods to start the engine, only to face failure.

For this very purpose, and so that all our readers can avoid being in such a situation, let’s investigate together why my Craftsman snowblower is not getting gas.

Stick throughout the article because you might spot why your snowblower is problematic.

## [](<>)**Why Is My Craftsman Snowblower Not Getting Gas? (Causes & Troubleshoot)**

Craftsman snowblower not getting gas is a phenomenon for multiple reasons.

Unlike other issues with your snowblower, for [fuel-related problems](https://surferhandy.com/stihl-fuel-tank-vent-problems/), there is no single origin we can trace back to the Craftsman snowblower not getting gas.

Therefore, in this section, we state all the possible reasons or components of the snowblower within which an issue can result in your Craftsman snowblower not getting gas.

### [](<>)**Problem: Inadequate Fuel Amount**

Usually, when the Craftsman snowblower is functioning normally, it only takes three pulls at the starter rope to get the engine roaring.

However, whenever there is some malfunctioning within the internal mechanisms of your snowblower, it will then take you more than three pulls at the starter rope to ignite the engine.

One common reason your engine may not start is that your Craftsman snowblower is not getting enough gas.

How may even the snowblower get enough gas when the amount of fuel present in the fuel tank is inadequate?

Every time the fuel amount in the tank decreases, the engine of your Craftsman snowblower will not get enough gas, and as a result, the machine will not start.

As obvious as this reason for your Craftsman snowblower not getting gas sounds, we guarantee this will be the problem in most instances.

This is because users often fail to note the amount of fuel in the tank, and even after refilling, they assume that the fuel they just added will last for a lifetime.

### [](<>)**Quick Troubleshoot**

There are no technicalities in quickly [troubleshooting](https://surferhandy.com/stihl-441-problem/) the issue of inadequate fuel amount in your Craftsman snowblower.

You must refill the tank with the most appropriate fuel, compatible with your Craftsman snowblower and in the proper amount.

By the term “accurate amount,” we mean to imply that the amount of fuel you add must not be too much nor too low; however, adequate for your snowblower to deliver its functioning at an optimal level.

### [](<>)**Problem: Fuel Gone Bad**

Previously, where we talked about inadequate fuel in the tank, constituting a reason for the Craftsman snowblower not getting gas.

Now we will be focusing on how and when the fuel goes bad.

Fuel gone bad is another prominent symptom of the snowblower not getting gas. One way the fuel in the machine can go bad is when the machine has not been used for a very long time.

Supposedly, you decide to store the machine away after the winters are over or it has stopped snowing, and the snowblower is no longer useful.

Meanwhile, you do not drain the fuel present anticipating reutilizing the same gas upon using the machine again.

During this span, whereby the machine is stored away, its present gas becomes contaminated and goes bad.

Most manufacturers, and even if you go through the Craftsman manual, then even the manufacturers of your snowblower will advise you not to use a machine that has fuel present in it that has been unused for 30 days or beyond because there is a risk of contamination that can severely and adversely affect the engine.

### [](<>)**Quick Troubleshoot**

Troubleshooting fuel gone bad quickly is to immediately drain the contaminated and bad fuel upon retrieval of the machine and refill the tank with new fuel.

Another alternative that can greatly benefit you and prevent your fuel from going bad in the future while you store the machine away is to use a stabilizer.

Every time from now on that you decide to put your machine away for more than 30 days, add a fuel stabilizer to the fuel.

This will prevent contamination and ensure keeping the fuel in such a condition that you can utilize it again without being problematic.

### [](<>)**Problem: Clogged Carburetor**

Carburetor is an essential part of the motor, which is responsible for ensuring that fuel and air combine in the accurate ratio to assist in combustion.

Hence, anything hindering this function of the [carburetor](https://surferhandy.com/fuel-leaking-carburetor-intake-weed-eater/) will lead to the Craftsman snowblower not getting gas.

The only way a carburetor can malfunction is when it gets clogged. It is not necessary for the carburetor to get clogged due to filth or dirt buildup.

That, too, is a possibility, but another possibility relating to the fuel problem is stale gas clogging the carburetor.

Stale gas has degraded to such an extent that it has lost its ability to combust and clogs your carburetor.

### [](<>)**Quick Troubleshoot**

Cleaning the clogged carburetor for dirt or filth is a comparatively convenient troubleshoot to make sure that the carburetor starts working again and does not disrupt the process of the snowblower receiving gas.

![](/uploads/carburetor-clogged-1-1-.png)

However, the same convenience is not available when ridding the carburetor of any stale gas.

In such a situation, there is only one option for you to opt for: to replace your old and worn-out, clogged carburetor with a brand-new one.

### [](<>)**Problem: Damaged Delivery Lines**

Certain pipelines installed inside your snowblower machine ensure that the fuel successfully and without any disruption reaches the engine so that it can have your machine running.

When these fuel delivery lines start to wear out on their exterior due to being constantly exposed to the generated heat during the snowblower’s functioning, they will no longer be useful.

In such instances, you can encounter cracks on the delivery lines, which can sometimes cause fuel leaks and the Craftsman snowblower not to get gas.

### [](<>)**Quick Troubleshoot**  

To quickly troubleshoot the issue of damaged delivery lines in your Craftsman snowblower, you must first start by identifying all problematic lines in their function.

Once you have succeeded, it is time to take measures to replace these lines

## [](<>)**Conclusion**

We have summed up all the reasons why is my Craftsman snowblower not getting gas. On this note- good luck troubleshooting!
