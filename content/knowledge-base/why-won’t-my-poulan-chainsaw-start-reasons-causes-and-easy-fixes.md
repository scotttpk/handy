  - question: What Fuel Mix Can I Add To My Poulan Chainsaw?
    answer: If having a 02 cycled Poulan chainsaw owning air cooled engine, then you
      require a fuel Mix of 3.2 ounces of oil per gallon of unleaded fresh fuel
      gas. The desired rates end up forming to 40:1 gas-to-oil ratio suitable
      for your Poulan chainsaw to work efficiently, avoid any friction or
      startup issues and overall reduce wear and tear, ensuring a smooth run.
  - question: How Much Does Poulan Chainsaw Carburetor Cost?
    answer: Multiple carburetors are available depending on the type and model of
      the Poulan chainsaw you are using. Remember, you might be charged 14$ to
      30$ when requiring a carburetor replacement for your Poulan chainsaw.
      Remember rate may vary per carburetor type and its compatibility with the
      chainsaw model.
  - question: How to Start my Poulan Gas-powered Chainsaw?
    answer: >-
      If dealing for the first time with a Poulan chainsaw, consider the
      following steps for an easy startup to avoid any issues. First, you need
      to check out and securely stabilize the Poulan chainsaw. Then go with
      engaging its chain brake. After that, on the chainsaw and slowly open up
      the choke.

      Once done, it’s time to prime the gasoline. When you have checked, the gas is provided properly, and the carburetor works fine; now, pull the chainsaw using a cord. Try several times to make it able to run. After that, you need to close the choke that was previously opened. Now air gasoline mixtures are adequately provided, and the chainsaw will start and run efficiently.

## **Why Won’t My Poulan Chainsaw Start- Quick answer!**

I tried several times, but the Poulan chainsaw needs to start. The issues might be a ***damaged, dirty carburetor***, ***[fueling problems](https://surferhandy.com/stihl-fuel-tank-vent-problems/) (bad, wrong, or old fuel),*** ***damaged or clogged fuel filter***, ***clogged fuel lines***, ***the issue with the spark plug***, ***[ignition coil](https://surferhandy.com/stihl-ignition-coil-problems/)***, etc., or both.

More of a ***[loose chain](https://surferhandy.com/stihl-chain-keeps-coming-loose/)***, ***damaged or worn-out pistons, and rings***, or ***poor recoil start*** will prevent the engine from starting and running.

The recoil starter has several parts, and ***damage to [pulleys](https://surferhandy.com/husqvarna-weed-eater-pull-not-catching/), ratchet***, and others would prevent the chainsaw from starting. But wait! Want to know more deals with fixes? Check out the next section.

### **Check Out The Spark Plug**

#### **Problem**

Damaged, worn out, or dirty spark plug causing no ignition and poor startup

##### **Reasons and causes**

If your [chainsaw isn’t starting](https://surferhandy.com/stihl-chainsaw-pull-not-working/) easily, then it means that it has a damaged, worn-out, or burnt spark plug that isn’t igniting the [fuel-air mixture](https://surferhandy.com/401-vs-501/) to let the chainsaw easily start; sometimes the spark plug may get flooded, and that’s another reason that prevents chainsaw from starting because it is wet fouled and contain moisture affecting the electrodes and not letting the engine to start properly.

![](/uploads/spark-plug.png)

In addition, the high carbon build-up will prevent your spark plug from igniting the fuel, leading to difficulty starting up the chainsaw.

##### **Troubleshoot**

To know whether the spark plug is worn out, try pulling the ***cord 15 times***. After 15 times, it still does not start, and the issue is the spark plug.

##### **Fix**

* Replace the damaged one
* Clean the dirty spark plug

### **Check Out Fueling**

#### **Problems**

Wrong, bad, or less fuel, wrong fuel oil mix, damaged or blocked fuel line, damaged or clogged fuel filter leading to the poor startup of chainsaw

![](/uploads/poulan-chainsaw-fuel-line.png)

#### **Reasons and causes**

if your change so isn’t starting, then the second reason can be issued with your fuel system either the fuel is not provided to the to get ignited or there might be blockage with the few line filter might be damaged or not working properly moreover a bad wrong and let’s view me also be the causative agents for not letting your change so to start properly.



#### **Troubleshoot** 

Check out the gas oil mix; if it is old, 60 days, then the issue might be with the fuel. Always concern the exact ratio of [40:1 or 50:1](https://surferhandy.com/401-vs-501/) of fresh gasoline and oil to ensure a good startup.

Check if the fuel filter is damaged or dirty. If anyone exists or both, you would find clogs and build-up that prevent the fuel from flowing.



You added fresh fuel, but still, a gas smell occurs when you start the. Fuel might have flooded. Try removing the excess.

#### **Fix**

* For wrong, bad or old fuel, replace it with fresh
* Go for exact ratios of oil-gas mix
* Replace or clean the fuel filter
* Clean the clogged fuel lines or replace them.



### **Check Out The Carburetor**

#### **Problem**

Dirty, damaged, or worn-out carburetor

#### **Reason and causes**

An issue with the carburetor is one of the most common reasons for your Poulan chainsaw not to start.

For that, you need to check whether your carburetor is vapor locked; if yes, then the fuel won’t flow in the carburetor; there is no ignition, and ultimately difficulty in chainsaw startup.

In addition, a dirty carburetor or damaged one can behave similarly, not letting the chainsaw start. When the gas cap is loose, the vapor lock prevents the fuel from flowing, and again, there is no engine startup.

#### **Fix**

* Clean the dirty carburetor
* Replace the damaged one
* Tighten the gas cap
* Maintaining the chainsaw if used after a year of storage.
* Clean the air filter



### **Check Out Ignition Coil**

![](/uploads/check-out-the-carburetor.png)

#### **Reasons and causes**

If the spark plug is fine, still no ignition occurs, then the issue is with the ignition coil.

The ignition coil works to add the spark to ignite the fuel, and any default or problem with the [starter coil](https://surferhandy.com/snowblower-electric-starter-not-working/) lets the fuel neither ignite nor run the engine. Check both the spark plug and ignition coil to troubleshoot.

#### **Fix**

* Clean or replace the sparkplug
* Replace the ignition coil



### **Check Out The Recoil Starter**

#### **Problem**

Fail engagement of crankshaft leading to no startup

#### **Reason and causes**

For the easy start of the engine, it’s pivotal that the recoil starts engaging the chainsaw crankshaft; if it does, then the [engine won’t start](https://surferhandy.com/husqvarna-128ld-wont-stay-running/), and no startup of the chainsaw occurs.

The engagement occurs through the recoil start pulley, so any loose, damaged, or worn-out pulley makes sense to be the cause for problems.



In addition, other parts like damaged springs, faulty cords, and jammed ratchet are also the common causative agents for failed engagement leading to not starting the chainsaw.

#### **Troubleshoot**

Check out the recoil state parts and pulleys and observe any damage, dirt, or jammed parts. Upon pulling the cord, the pulley isn’t starting. Then the issue is with the pulley. If found loose or damaged, go for the fix.

#### **Fix**

* Replace the damaged starter
* Secure the loose belts
* Replace the damaged pulley
* Replace the damaged cords and springs
* Un-jammed the ratchet



### **Check Out The Piston And Rings**

#### **Problem**

Pistons and rings, when worn out, lead to no startup

#### **Reason and cause**

Pistons secure the combustion chamber and properly seal it, but when the seals are worn out, loose, or damaged, there are chances that the combustion chamber will not work properly, resulting in a poor startup.

If the entire piston seems damaged, it won’t cause the engine to start.

#### **Fix**

* Replace the piston and rings
* Tighten the rings
