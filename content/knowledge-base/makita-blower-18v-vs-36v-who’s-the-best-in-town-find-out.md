  - question: "**How efficient is an 18V battery Makita leaf blower?**"
    answer: >-
      Consider getting an 18-volt lithium-ion battery for your leaf blower, or
      one coming with the battery will provide you a run time of 20-30 minutes
      to let you easily blow off leaves and clear the path.\

      For instance, you can consider one of the leaf blowers with an 18-volt battery that fits more than 100 tools in the Ryobi One System and provides a limited warranty of 03 years.
  - question: "**What is the battery voltage range to opt for a leaf blower?**"
    answer: >-
      18-84 volt lithium-ion battery\

      Consider a; leaf blower to be efficient in performance with a battery ranging from 18-84 volts for low, medium, and heavy-duty tasks.\

      A high-performance blower would have 40 volts and above voltage to meet the working demands.
  - question: "**Which is more powerful, an 18v Makita leaf blower or 36 volts?**"
    answer: >-
      As the number of volts increases, the equipment’s battery power is
      enhanced, and more power is given to let the blower handle the lawn,
      pavements, and yards more easily.\

      So, a 36-volt leaf blower will be more powerful when compared to 18 volts. For normal tasks and less heavy-duty work, getting 18 volts seems favorable.\

      The 36-inch can even go with long grass, while the 18-volt is better for medium.
  - question: "**Can I use a 40 volts battery on 18 volt Makita leaf blower?**"
    answer: No, you cannot see pt for a high-volt battery for the equipment
      compatible with low volts because it can ruin the performance and system,
      so always consider the consistent volts to achieve the desired efficiency
      and working experience with a tool.
