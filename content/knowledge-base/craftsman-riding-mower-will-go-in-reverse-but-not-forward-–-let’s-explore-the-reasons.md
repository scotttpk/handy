### [](<>)**Reasons Behind Mower Causing Problems In Working**

#### [](<>)**Damaged Drive Belt**

The drive belt is the critical component of the mower as it is directly connected to the wheels, and any issue that happens to the strap has a direct impact on the movement of the [mower](https://surferhandy.com/sulky-for-walk-behind-mower/).

Old, slippery or damaged belts can cause problems for the mower and at times, the working gets disturbed to such an extent that the [mower starts](https://surferhandy.com/toro-lawn-mower-wont-start/) to move backwards rather than forward.

In such cases where the belt has become slippery or got damaged, it should be replaced immediately to resume the working of the mower, as the mower can not work without the belt.

#### [](<>)**Mower Got Stuck In Mud**

Mower sticking in the mud shows that it lacks friction; the wheels of the mowers are not capable enough to cross the mud, especially the wet mud.

Moreover, once the mower gets stuck in the ground, it becomes tough to move from there, especially if the mower is a big one.

To avoid such situations, wheels must be prepared, and some friction must be added to them, which can be done by adding some of the things discussed below;

* Some sheet of panel kind of material

Must be added under the wheels

* [Chain link](https://surferhandy.com/70-vs-72-link-chainsaw-chain/) panels with fences
* Sheets of plywood or chip wood
* Plastic or compact sheets
* Chains

#### [](<>)**Mower Got Stuck In Gear**

This happens rarely but can cause trouble when it happens. The mower got stuck in its gear, which merely happens due to the wear and tear of the components, misuse of the equipment and bags not being handled correctly.

First, it is essential to know what sort of mower you have; there are a lot of options available in the market, which includes; a mower with a manual clutch mower having an automatic operation clutch. Every gear needs to be tackled differently.

When the mower gets stuck in gear, professional help must be sought to avoid any further issues, as an expert can clearly state what has happened and what sort of replacement is required. Doing things on your own may increase the problem.

#### [](<>)**Old Hydraulic Fluid In The Transmission**

Hydraulic fluid assists in the smooth working of the mower, though, at times, the fluid loses its capacity and does not work accordingly.

In such situations, the mower fails to move as it does not get any lubrication in the wheel.

Fluid, when it gets old, causes this issue and loses its original value of lubricating the wheels.

**To resolve the issue,** the fluid must be checked regularly and kept up to date so that the wheels should get the desired amount of lubrication without any delays.

Professionals should do this better, but users can also do this at home but with extra care, as fluid needs to be handled with extra precautions.

#### [](<>)**Air In Hydraulic Fluid Lines**

Air incurring in the hydraulic fluid lines hinders the working of the mower as the testicles stop the engine from working correctly.

This should be tackled as soon as it gets noticed because a more significant cause means more trouble and needs professional help to be dealt with.

The main reason behind making these tables is the mower remaining idle for some time, and this usually happens in [winter](https://surferhandy.com/wood-stove-vs-wood-furnace/) and snowy seasons when the mower remains unused for some days.

The hydraulic fluid must be changed or checked regularly to avoid air bubbles.

Especially at times when the mower remains idle for some time, the user should make sure that no fluid is left in the hydraulic line so that there must not any chances of air bubbles.

#### [](<>)**Lost Wheel Key Stock**

The wheel key contains some small tinny components but has some exceptional features.

While using a mower on grass, these wheel key stocks usually get lost, and then it causes trouble to the user when the wheel does not work according to requirements.

To avoid this issue, users must keep track of the mower’s movements and must check whether any of the components is missing or not.

Once you find the lost wheel key stock, fix it to the required place for resuming the working of the mower.

## **Conclusion**

The article above states many reasons that contribute to the issue of **craftsman riding mower will go in reverse but not forward**, though, among all the main points was problems with the wheel, which got stuck due to lack of friction and must be settled with a plastic sheet, wooden sheet or many other options to avoid the stocking and wrong side working of the mower.
