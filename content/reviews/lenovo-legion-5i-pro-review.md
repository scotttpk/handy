The Lenovo Legion 5i Pro illustrates that 2022 has been a great year for *[gaming laptops](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/best-gaming-laptops)*. This year, we’ve seen beastly rigs push the envelope with pure, unadulterated power while others disrupted the whole industry with fascinating new form factors.

Then there’s the third category: really good gaming laptops that have been born through years of iterative development. That’s the category the Lenovo Legion 5i Pro falls into with its supreme thermal performance, great-to-use keyboard and touchpad, and its refined visual design.

I wrote about why you should just *[get a gaming laptop now and ignore the RTX 40 Series](https://www.laptopmag.com/news/now-is-the-best-time-to-buy-a-new-gaming-laptop-dont-wait-for-rtx-40-series)*, because chances are you’ll see a bit of a price premium added to them. Does the Legion 5i Pro prove me right? As you can see by that score, the answer is quite the resounding “yes.”

## Lenovo Legion 5i Pro Price and Configurations

The *[Lenovo Legion 5i Pro starts at $1,499](https://lenovo.7eer.net/c/221109/218864/3808?subId1=laptopmag-gb-6870478737211050000&sharedId=laptopmag-gb&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Flaptops%2Flegion-laptops%2Flegion-5-series%2Flegion-5i-pro-gen-7-%2816-inch-intel%29%2Flen101g0015)*(opens in new tab). I would say the retail price is listed as $1,789, but I wouldn’t believe that number for a second. From past experience, we’ve seen Lenovo up its on-site prices significantly to make the actual cost look like a deal.

Inflated pricing is a whole other rant for another day, but to prove my point, a configuration with the same specs is on *[Amazon](https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?tsid=45727&GR_URL=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2FLenovo-Legion-NVIDIA-G-Sync-i7-12700H%2Fdp%2FB0B1SFL5PK%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26ascsubtag%3Dlaptopmag-gb-4077966298295129000-20)*(opens in new tab) for the same price — with no indication of a discount. So, just ignore the original pricing published on the Legion 5i Pro’s page. As of this writing, its current price tag is the laptop’s *true* valuation.

To match the specs we got in both of our laptops:

* Intel Core i7-12700H processor, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 Ti GPU, 16GB DDR5 RAM, 512GB SSD: $1,860
* Same as above, but with 32GB DDR5 RAM, and a 1TB SSD: $2,050

This puts it squarely in the same territory as the likes of the *[Asus ROG Zephyrus G15](https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-2022)* ($2,000) and more powerful versions of the *[MSI Vector GP76](https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/msi-vector-gp76)* ($2,699).

## Lenovo Legion 5i Pro Design

In a tidal wave of super masculine-looking gaming laptops, the Lenovo Legion 5i Pro (and 5 Pro) is a sleek system that you would not be embarrassed to whip out in public. That’s quite the achievement, given the massive 16-inch display this thing is packing.

The external shell is adorned with refined, polished stylings, from its metallic-gray lid to the premium plastic underside and rear chin.

The RGB is kept tastefully minimal so it doesn’t look like you’re hosting a rave party on your deck. Plus, the dimensions are tight and the weight is respectable at 14.1 x 10.4 x 1 inches and 5.5 pounds.

This is a svelte system that, quite frankly, embarrasses the Vector GP76 (15.6 x 11.2 x 1 inches, 6.4 pounds), but doesn’t quite match the svelte nature of the ROG Zephyrus G15 (14 x 9.6 x 0.8 inches, 4.8 pounds). This aside, it’s abundantly clear that you’re getting something nice here.
