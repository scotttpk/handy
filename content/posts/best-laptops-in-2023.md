          The Dell XPS 13 OLED is what happens when the best laptop meets the
          latest display technology. Combining the two creates something close
          to magic —  an ultra-portable device capable of running most tasks
          while providing a cinema-like viewing experience. Everything we love
          about the other XPS configurations remains, including the fast
          performance, striking design, and top-rate touchpad. 


          The latest XPS 13 model debuts a gorgeous OLED panel that provides rich picture quality for when you're streaming movies at home or editing videos for work. Is it worth the tradeoff to battery life? If you need a high-res display, then yes. The 3.5K OLED display outlasted the 4K IPS config in our battery test and is capable of producing a wider range of colors. Equipped with an Intel Core i7-1185G7 CPU with 16GB of RAM, the XPS 13 is small but mighty.


          Overall, the XPS 13 OLED brings an excellent display upgrade to what was already our favorite laptop, and it does so without too many sacrifices.
    pros:
      - pro: Breathtaking 3.5K OLED display
      - pro: Striking, ultra-thin design
      - pro: Fast performance

## How we test laptops

Laptop Mag has been testing and reviewing laptops for three decades. We test over 150 different models per year, subjecting each system to a series of rigorous benchmarks that provides a complete picture of performance, battery life and usability.

Our expert reviewers also use each product to see how it looks and feels in everyday situations. Because we see so many different notebooks, we can compare each to its direct competitors and give you an idea of how it stacks up to the average laptop in its price band.

When we bring a laptop into our laboratory, our goal is to see how it would work if you brought it into your home or office. While we use a number of industry standard benchmarks such as Geekbench and 3DMark, we focus heavily on real-world tests that we have developed in-house.

To test endurance, the Laptop Mag Battery test surfs the web at 150 nits of brightness until the system runs out of juice. To judge pure processing power, we use a giant spreadsheet macro that matches 65,000 names with their addresses, a video transcoder that converts a 4K video to 1080p and the Geekbench 4 synthetic test. We measure graphics prowess with both 3DMark Ice Storm / Fire Strike and a series of actual game titles.

We use a colorimeter to measure screen brightness and color gamut while other instruments help us determine a laptop's key travel and ambient heat. See this page on How We Test Laptops for more details on our benchmarking procedures.

## How to find the right laptop

When shopping for a laptop, there's a lot to consider. To help you choose a system, we've put our up-to-date list of favorite notebooks above, along with five points to keep in mind when choosing a system.

**Budget: What you get for the money.**

You can find good cheap Windows laptops and high-quality Chromebooks for under $500. However, better mainstream laptops usually cost more than $700 and premium [Ultrabooks](https://www.laptopmag.com/best-ultrabooks) can run over $1,000. The [best gaming laptops](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/best-gaming-laptops) can cost $2.000 and up, but you can play the latest titles at decent frame rates on [gaming laptops under $1,500](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/sub-1000-gaming-laptops) as well as the [best gaming laptops under $1,000](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/sub-1000-gaming-laptops).

**Screen Size: 12 to 14 inches for Portability**

Knowing a laptop's screen size tells you a lot about its portability overall. If you want to use your computer on your lap or carry it around a lot, go for one with a 12, 13 or 14-inch display. If you want to use the computer on tables and desks and won't carry it around much, a 15-inch model may give you more value. Some gaming rigs, media machines and workstations even have 17 or 18-inch screens, but those are hardest to carry.

**2-in-1 or Clamshell?**

More and more of today's laptops are [2-in-1s](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/best-2-in-1-laptops) with screens that either bend back 360 degrees or detach so you can use them as tablets. If you like the idea of using your laptop in slate mode for drawing, media consumption or just using it standing up, a [2-in-1 could be for you](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/hybrid-laptop-buying-guide). However, you can often get better features or a lower price by going with a traditional clamshell-style laptop.

**Battery Life: 8+ Hours for Portability**

Unless you only plan to use your laptop on your desk, battery life matters. Even within the home or office, having plenty of juice enables you to work on the couch or at the conference table, without being chained to the nearest outlet. For the best portability, we recommend getting a laptop that lasted over 8 hours on the Laptop Mag Battery Test. The [longest-lasting laptops](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/all-day-strong-longest-lasting-notebooks) endure for over 10 hours.

**Specs: 1080p / Core i5 / 8GB Are Best Bets**

You can spend a lot of time delving into specs, but here are the key components to think about. If you just want really good mainstream performance, go for a Core i5 CPU, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB SSD and a 1080p screen.

* **Screen Resolution:** Unfortunately, [66 percent of consumer laptops](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/laptop-screen-resolution-ripoff) and [51 percent of business systems](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/businesses-shouldnt-buy-1366-laptops) have low-res screens. If at all possible, get a display with a 1920 x 1080 (aka 1080p or full HD) or higher resolution. If you're a content creator, you'll want to look into at least a 2.5K resolution panel. And if you're a gamer, definitely pay attention to the refresh and response rate. We recommend 144Hz and 3-millisecond, respectively. 
* **CPU:** An [Intel Core i5](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/cpu-comparison) provides good mainstream performance. Some budget systems will come with Core i3, Celeron or Pentium CPUs which are good enough for basic tasks, but not heavy mutltiasking. Get a Core i7 or a quad core processor (serial number ends in HQ or HK) for gaming or high-end productivity tasks such as video editing and 3D modeling. AMD is enjoying a renaissance with its Ryzen line of processors. Ryzen 7 is the middle-of-the-road chip that will bring mainstream performance while Ryzen 5 and 9 cover your entry level and power user needs. And of course we can't forget Apple with its M-series chips based on ARM architecture that  has taken the industry by storm.
* **RAM**: 8GB is ideal for most users. 4GB is acceptable for budget systems. Secondary laptops and Chromebooks may have less.
* **Storage:** Unless you're a gamer or a power user, 256GB of internal storage is probably enough. If at all possible, [get an SSD](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/ssds-are-worth-it) (Solid State Drive) rather than a hard drive, because it's going to make your entire computer a lot faster.
* **Graphics Chip:** Gamers and creative professionals need to do some research and figure out which [discrete GPU](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/gpu-comparison) is good enough to run their favorite software. Everyone else will be happy with the built-in [Intel HD Graphics](https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/intel-hd-graphics-comparison) that come on the CPU.
